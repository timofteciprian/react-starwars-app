    <h1>Star Wars</h1>
    <p>
      Star Wars is a science-fiction franchise comprising movies, books, comics,
      video games, toys, and animated shows. It is a fictional universe created
      by George Lucas. The Star Wars story employs archetypal motifs common to
      science fiction, political climax and classical mythology, as well as
      musical motifs of those aspects. As one of the foremost examples of the
      space opera subgenre of science fiction, Star Wars has become part of
      mainstream popular culture, as well as being one of the highest-grossing
      series of all time. It is currently the second highest-grossing film
      series behind only the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[1] and also the second
      highest-grossing media franchise of all time (with only the Japanese
      franchise Pok√©mon outranking it).
